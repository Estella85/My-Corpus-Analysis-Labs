So it might be difficult to make generalizations that tell us what a good hotel is, across lots of cities and types of guests. So now we have (1) our data from hotel reviews and (2) our sentiment vectorizer (positive and negative words). We're going to classify these by quality. The basic code is below; this just called our *text_analytics* package. That package splits the data into training and testing data, learns a classifier, and then evaluates the classifier. We're telling the package to use \"Rating\" as the ground-truth class, with sentiment features."
